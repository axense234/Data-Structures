// Binary Tree = a tree where each node can have at most 2 children
// Strict/Proper Binary Tree = a tree where each node can have either 2 or 0 children
// Complete Binary Tree = a tree where all levels except possibly the last one are completely filled and all nodes are as left as possible
// Perfect Binary Tree = a tree where all levels are completely filled
// Balanced Binary Tree = difference between height of left subtree and right subtree for every node is not more than k(mostly 1)
// Binary Search Tree = a binary tree where for each node value of all nodes on the left subtree are lesser and the value of the all the nodes on the right subtree are greater

// Max N of nodes at i level is: = 2^i
// Max N of nodes of a binary tree with height H is: 2^H+1 - 1

// Height of a Perfect Binary Tree with N nodes: log2(N+1) - 1
// Height of a Complete Binary Tree with N nodes: [log2(N)]

/// Min Height of a Binary Tree with N nodes is: [log2 n]
/// Max Height of a Binary Tree with N nodes is: n - 1

// Height of an Empty Tree is: -1
// Height of a Tree with 1 node is: 0
